For Open Source or event maintainers that share a project Mastodon account, `toot-together` is a GitHub Action that utilizes text files to publish toots from a GitHub repository. Rather than posting your toots directly, GitHub’s pull request review process encourages more collaboration, Mastodon activity and editorial contributions by enabling everyone to submit toot drafts to a project.

## Try it

You can submit a toot to this repository to see the magic happen. Please follow the instructions at [toots/README.md](toots/README.md) and mention your own Mastodon username in the toot. This repository has been set up to send toots via [https://social.tchncs.de/@commit2toot](https://social.tchncs.de/@commit2toot).

## Setup

1. [Create a Mastodon app](docs/01-create-mastodon-app.md) for your shared Mastodon account and store the credentials as `MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN` in your repository’s secrets settings.
2. [Create a `.github/workflows/toot-together.yml` file](docs/02-create-toot-together-workflow.md) with the content below. Make sure to replace `'master'` if you changed your repository's default branch.

   ```yml
   on: [push, pull_request]
   name: Toot, together!
   jobs:
     preview:
       name: Preview
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
       steps:
         - uses: joschi/toot-together@v1.x
           env:
             GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
     toot:
       name: Toot
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/master'
       steps:
         - name: checkout master
           uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - name: Toot
           uses: joschi/toot-together@v1.x
           env:
             GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
             # URL to the instance hosting your Mastodon account
             MASTODON_URL: https://www.mastodon.example/
             MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
   ```

3. After creating or updating `.github/workflows/toot-together.yml` in your repository’s default branch, a pull request will be created with further instructions.

Happy collaborative tooting! 🐘

## How it works

`toot-together` is using two workflows

1. `push` event to publish new toots
2. `pull_request` event to validate and preview new toots

### The `push` event

When triggered by the `push` event, the script looks for added `*.toot` files in the `toots/` folder or subfolders. If there are any, a toot for each added `*.toot` file is published.

If there is no `toots/` subfolder, the script opens a pull request creating the folder with further instructions.

### The `pull_request` event

For the `pull_request` event, the script handles only `opened` and `synchronize` actions. It looks for new `*.toot` files in the `toots/` folder or subfolders. If there are any, the length of each toot is validated. If one is too long, a failed check run with an explanation is created. If all toots are valid, a check run with a preview of all toots is created.

## Motivation

I think we can make Open Source more inclusive to people with more diverse interests by making it easier to contribute other things than code and documentation. I see a particularly big opportunity to be more welcoming towards editorial contributions by creating tools using GitHub’s Actions, Apps and custom user interfaces backed by GitHub’s REST & GraphQL APIs.

I’ve plenty more ideas that I’d like to build out. Please ping me on Mastodon if you’d like to chat: [@joschi@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@joschi).
