# Create a Mastodon app

You can create a Mastodon app for your Mastodon account in your account settings under "Development" -> "Your applications", for example https://mastodon.social/settings/applications/new if your account is hosted on [mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/).

## Create an app

![](mastodon-03-create-app.png)

Only 2 questions are required. Here are my answers for reference.

### Application name (required)

An application name to identify it for your account, for example `toot-together`.

### Application website (optional)

https://github.com/joschi/toot-together

### Scopes

The `toot-together` GitHub Action does only require the `write` scope.

## Save credentials

Open your newly created app in the "Development" tab and copy the string next to "Your access token".

Now save the credentials into your repositoryâ€™s "Secrets" settings as follows:

| Mastodon Credential name | GitHub Secret name      |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Your access token        | `MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN` |
